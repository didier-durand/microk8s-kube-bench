# MicroK8s & Kubernetes security benchmark from CIS

## Goal & Deliverables

![workflow badge](https://github.com/didier-durand/microk8s-kube-bench/workflows/MicroK8s%20Kube-bench/badge.svg)

MicroK8s analysed for CIS benchmark with kube-bench. 

This repository implements a 100% automated workflow (via [microk8s-kube-bench.yml](.github/workflows/microk8s-kube-bench.yml) + [microk8s-kube-bench.sh](sh/microk8s-kube-bench.sh)) providing the installation of Microk8s on Ubuntu (run as a Github CI /CD worker). Kube-bench is then deployed and executed to obtain the analysis of the configuration of this Kubernetes cluster.

Last execution report on Github CI/CD is appended below.

All suggestions for improvements or extensions are welcome. Same for pull requests!

## MicroK8s

[Microk8s](https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s) by Canonical is single-package, fully conformant and lightweight Kubernetes distribution that works 
on numerous flavours of Linux. It is aimed at developer workstations, IoT, Edge & CI/CD. Simple to manage, this pure upstream distribution has 
same-day tracking for new releases, patches generated by root project. The [Snap package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(package_manager)) 
takes care of corresponding automated updates when new upstream code gets pushed.

Canonical additionally provides various preconfigured [standard K8s add-ons](https://microk8s.io/docs/addons) on top of the raw distribution: 
dashboard, istio, knative, metallb, cilium, kubeflow, etc.  They make MicroK8s quite suitable for advanced tests on a laptop. It is also a very 
easy way to [get started](https://microk8s.io/tutorials) with K8s on an autonomous / personal system.

 
## Kube-bench

As [per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Internet_Security): *"The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit 
organization, formed in October, 2000. Its mission is to "identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best practice 
solutions for cyber defense and build and lead communities to enable an environment of trust in cyberspace".The organization is headquartered in 
East Greenbush, New York, with members including large corporations, government agencies, and academic institutions."*

[kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) by [Aqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com/) is a Go application that analyses how securely 
Kubernetes is deployed by running the checks documented in the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/).
Tests are configured with YAML files, making this tool easy to update as test specifications evolve.

The numbered items (like 1.2.3) found in execution report below correspond to the various points being defined and commented with this same number 
in the [official documentation](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/) of the benchmark.

[This article](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-harden-your-kubernetes-cluster-with-kube-bench-fae71eb24d8) delivers deep and interesting 
insights on the benchmark.
